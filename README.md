# Paris

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/paris.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/paris)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40microsoft%2Fparis.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40microsoft%2Fparis)

Paris is a data management library for webapps, using TypeScript and RxJS to implement Domain-Driven Design.

*Paris, fashion capital of the world, where all the **models** want to be*.
 

## Installation

*Package size: ~15.8kb (gzipped)*

1. Paris is a TypeScript library and also requires RxJs and lodash, so you'll need both those packages, if you don't already use them:

	```
	npm install --save lodash-es rxjs typescript
	```

2. Install the Paris NPM package:

	```
	npm install --save @microsoft/paris
	```

## Features

- Data API abstraction and standardization - define and use your data easily, in a consistent way.
- Strong-typed - data models are defined as classes with TypeScript
- Full-tree modeling - Paris handles the creation of models and sub-models, essentially creating a model tree.
- Implements Domain-Driven Design - true and tested development methodology that improves collaboration.
- Reactive - all async code is done with RxJS Observables.
- Caching - easily cache data (including time-based caching).


## Usage

First, define an Entity:

```typescript
// todo-item.entity.ts

import { Entity, EntityModelBase, EntityField } from "@microsoft/paris";

@Entity({
	singularName: "Todo Item",
	pluralName: "Todo Items",
	endpoint: "todo/items"
})
export class TodoItem extends EntityModelBase{
	@EntityField()
	text: string;

	@EntityField()
	time: Date;
}
```

The above defines an Entity, which can be used to query the todo/items server endpoint, like this:

```typescript
import { Paris } from "@microsoft/paris";

const paris = new Paris();
paris.getItemById(TodoItem, 1).subscribe((todoItem:TodoItem) => {
	console.log("Todo item with ID 1: ", todoItem);
});
```
